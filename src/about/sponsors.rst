   `GitHub Sponsor <todo>`_
   `Buy me a coffee <https://buymeacoffee.com/silverrainz>`_

I am the author of `Srain IRC Client`__ and `Sphinx Notes Project`__. I am also a package maintainer of `Arch Linux CN Repository`__ since 2016.

I used to work on writing modern IRC client. More recently, I've been focusing on using Sphinx for knowledge management. I've written a series of tools around it (GitHub actions, extensions, CLI tools, and more), and I've contributed `over 10 patches to Sphinx`__.

Sponsoring me will free me up to contribute to the open source world, especially to the Sphinx ecosystem.

Thank you for your generosity!
