I am passionate about (in no particular order):

- creating interesting images (in other words: painting)
- programming (what a typical programmer!)
- building `structured note taking system`__, which is the website you're visiting now (+2!)
- building self-hosted services (+3!)
- saving money (what a typical Chinese!)
- :people:`Swan`, a lovely girl
